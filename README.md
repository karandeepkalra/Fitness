   - Browse and book yoga tutor appointments.
   - Make payments for bookings.
   - Cancel appointments if needed.

2. **Tutors**:

- Dynamic user role handling (Student/Tutor).
- Appointment booking and cancellation.
- Payment gateway integration for seamless transactions.
- Backend support for data storage and retrieval.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Tools**:
  - Postman for API testing.

## Backend Details

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js with Express.js**: Handles the API endpoints and server-side logic.
- **MongoDB**: Serves as the database for storing user data, appointments, and transactions.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for secure user authentication.
- **Middleware**:
  - Authentication middleware to protect routes.
  - Error-handling middleware for graceful error management.

### API Endpoints
1. **User Authentication**:
   - `POST /use/`: Register a new user (Student/Tutor).
   - `POST /user/login`: Login a user and generate a token.

2. **Update Profile**:
   - `GET /user/get-Profile`: Fetch user profile data.
   - `POST /user/update-profile`: update user profile.

### Database Schema
- **User Schema**:
  - Name, Email, Password

### Setup Instructions
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a remote connection string.
- Use Postman or a similar tool to test API endpoints during development.
- Add any additional backend dependencies using:
  ```bash
  npm install nodemon cors 
  ```
